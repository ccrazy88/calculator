# Calculator

## Required Tasks

> Get the Calculator working as demonstrated in lectures 1 and 2. The
> Autolayout portion at the end of the lecture is extra credit, but give it a
> try because getting good at autolayout requires experience. If you do not do
> autolayout, be sure to position everything so that it is visible on all
> iPhones (i.e. the upper left corner of the scene).

exceptions:

- "MARK" comments added for increased readability
